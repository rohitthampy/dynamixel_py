## About this library

This is more of a python wrapper than a library.

It has two classes. 
- `XL33Comm` is responsible for opening and starting a communication port like USB.
- `XL330Ctrl` is responsible for controlling dynamixel motors. You can use it for things such as getting the position of the servo, sending to to a goal position etc.
